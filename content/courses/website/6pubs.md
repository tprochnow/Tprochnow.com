## Editing the Widget

1. Navigate to `content/home/publications.md`
2. Choose the viewing style or citation style you would like. 

## Adding Projects

Just like in the project widget, I went rogue here as well. 

1. Navigate to the `content/publication` folder.
2. Create a folder with a short title or accronym for your paper. 
3. Place the sample publication .md inside of it. 
4. From here change the sample .md file to say `index.md`.
5. Edit the `index.md` file with your publication information.
6. Don't forget to add any tags or project information here. 
7. If you would like to add a picture to be featured on the page add a JPEG file to this folder titled `featured.jpg`.

## Featured Publications

Some people like to highlight some of their publications. This could be recent publications or to signify first author publications from some of the other publications. I have done the later on my website. To do this you will need to:

1. Make sure to denote inside the individual publication document where it says featured. Change this to true.
2. Navigate to the `content/home/featured.md` document to edit any viewing options. 

## No Pubs For You?

If you don't want this widget you will have to edit this in two different locations

1. `Menu.toml` - comment out the part with Publications.
2. In the `content/home/publications.md` and `featured.md` change `active=true` to `active=false`.
