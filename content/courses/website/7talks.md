## Editing the Widget

1. Navigate to `content/home/talks.md`
2. From here you can change the way the dates are shown as well as the title of the section. I went with presentations but this could also be used for webinars, workshops, and the like. What ever is most useful for you. 

## Adding Talks

Talks are the one form of content that I have not put in individual folders like with projects and publications. You can do that if it helps you (this will also help if you want feature pictures like in projects and publications) but we can still do what we need without it.  

1. To edit and add talks navigate to the `content/talk` folder.
2. From here you can edit the sample one and copy and paste the document to add new ones. 
3. While editing you can add an abstract, details about the presentation, and links to the presentation itself including PDFs or slides.
4. If you are adding an abstract, the code will not work with line breaks. You will have to manually enter them in markdown using ```<br /><br /> ```
5. If you would like to add a pdf of the poster or slides make sure you add the pdf to the `static/files` folder in a .pdf format. 
6. Don't forget to link it to a project if necessary.


## No Talks For You?

If you don't want this widget you will have to edit this in two different locations

1. `Menu.toml` - comment out the part with Talks.
2. In the `content/home/talks.md` change ```active=true``` to ``active=false``.
