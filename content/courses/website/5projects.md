First, we will start with the project widget. By projects I mean any way of separating your work (papers, presentations, blogs) into different families or projects to be searched easily. If your work is not typically project based you can skip this section; you may wish to follow the instructions to delete the widget or make it inactive. 

## Why start here

Personally, I think this is a great place to start as it will build into some of the other work. As you build out any presentations, papers, or blogs you can add them to the projects so viewers can easily go between works that come from the same project. 

## Editing the Widget

1. Navigate to `content/home/projects.md`
2. You can choose to sort projects in a certain way or choose to deactivate this portion by adding a #.
3. You can choose the way in which they are displayed on the page. I have chosen "5" or the showcase for my page. Feel free to play around with the views and see what you like. 

## Adding Projects

Instead of using the traditional format in the Academic theme, I called an audible. 

1. Navigate to the `content/project` folder.
2. Create a folder with a short title or accronym for your project. 
3. Place the sample project .md inside of it. 
4. From here change the sample .md file to say `index.md`.
5. Edit the `index.md` file with your project information.
6. If you would like to add a picture to be featured on the page add a JPEG file to this folder titled `featured.jpg`.

When going forward if you would like a presentation or paper to be linked to this project enter the folder name into the project area of the presentation or paper document.

## No Projects For You!

If you don't want this widget you will have to edit this in two different locations

1. `Menu.toml` - comment out the part with Project.
2. In the `content/home/projects.md` change `active=true` to `active=false`.
