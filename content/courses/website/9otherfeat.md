## Adding CV

So there should be two main places to find your CV on your website if not more.

1. The top Menu bar
2. CV icon below your picture

In order to make sure this is accurate and easy to update all you need to do is put a current CV titled cv.pdf in the `static/file` folder. Simple as that. 

## Analytics

One thing you should be thinking about is tracking how many people visit your site and what are they looking at. An easy and free way of doing this is by following the instructions on [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/). They will walk you through everything step-by-step so that you can track your site activity. 

You will need to access your `config.toml` file to add in the google analytics code in order to track analytics and Search Engine Optimization. 

## Search Engine Optimization

Next, we need to make sure Google can easily find you and so you can track how your Search Engine Optimization is. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to get started.

Some things to remember to boost your SEO:

* Link, Link, Link - By linking to other pages on your website and also by having other pages link to yours, you will gain visability and have a better chance of getting a search engine to pick up your content.
* Use appropriate titles to pages - Never keep it Untitled, or Sample and always make sure it is in line with the content you are providing. 
* Make content - The more content you have on your site the more chances people will come to and stay on your site.
