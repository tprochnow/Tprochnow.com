The last feature or widget we will go over is the doc widget. Currently, the demo site uses the docs widget for blog posts but it can be used for a number of other things like this tutorial for example. We will start with using it as a blog as that is currently set up on your home page. I kind of had to backdoor the docs widget to use it as a tutorial section which I will show you later. 

## Blog

Blogs are a very great way to disseminate information or share ideas in an informal manner. Some of you may have a very blog heavy website. As you can see I do not; however, I will still show you how to do this. The directions will be very similar to how you would create and edit presentations and publications but you can add different elements to a blog setting. 

### Editing the Widget

1. Navigate to `content/home/posts.md`
2. Choose the viewing style or citation style you would like.
3. From here you can also change the placement on the page as well as how many you would like to show up. 

### Adding/Editing Posts

1. Your site should come with sample posts in the `content/post` folder. 
2. In order to make things easier we will again make each post its own folder.
3. Drag and drop the sample into a new folder and title it what ever you would like. 
4. Here it is very similar to the presentations or publications. You can edit text, insert pictures, and change formatting as you see fit. See Other Resources for some cheat sheets in formatting. 

## Courses

As I said above this widget can also be used for tutorials. In order to do so I copied a bit of code from the demo site that is not typically built into the site you are given from the beginning. 

1. To start I would go to [George Cushen's GitHub Page](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/content/courses) and download the courses folder. 
2. This folder will include one example tutorial. If you would like to make more than one Tutorial you should put each of them in their own folder inside the courses folder. 
3. From here you will be able to edit each page to your liking. 
4. To add new pages simply make a copy of one of the example pages. 
5. If you do this be sure to pay attention to the `menu` section at the top of each page. this current page looks like this 
```{r eval=FALSE}
menu:
  website:
    parent: 2) Editing Your Site
    weight: 8
```
    
6. Remember to update your `menu.toml` file in case you make any changes to this section.
