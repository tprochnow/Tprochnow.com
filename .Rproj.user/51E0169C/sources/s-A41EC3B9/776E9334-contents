## What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open source depository for website frames and designs. Closely linked to [GitHub](https://github.com/), Hugo stores the work of many programers and developers and shares code for flexible, dynamic websites. It also has a R studio package that we will be using in order to serve and edit the site offline.  


## Hugo Themes

For this workshop we will be using the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) because of its widgets and specialization towards academia. However, below I have listed a few of my other favorites in case you want to explore a new look.

* [Timer theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/timer-hugo/)
* [Minimo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/)
* [Sustain theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-sustain/)
* [Lodi theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lodi-theme/)
* [Future Imperfect theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/)

## Academic Theme

The Academic theme is what we will be using here. [This](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/) is a demo of what you can expect right away with the theme.
