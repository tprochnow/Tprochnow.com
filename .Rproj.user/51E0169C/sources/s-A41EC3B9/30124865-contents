From the files portion of your R Studio you can navigate through the website files located within your GitHub desktop repository. We will be accessing multiple files with this navigation feature. Additionally, you can add, copy, or remove files in the folder found in your documents section. This comes in handy when adding files or pictures later.

## Author Profile

First, let's edit your author profile. This will be the first thing people will see when they access your website. 

1. Navigate through your file to content/authors/admin/_index.md 
2. Here you can edit your display name, position, bio, and education.
3. When entering your interests keep them short and try to build a theme throughout your profile.
4. You can add icons and buttons below your profile picture by uncommenting (deleting the #) and adding your link. The more of these you can use the better your search engine numbers will be. We will talk about this later. 
5. At the bottom of this document you can add a bio that will appear at the top of your page. Keep this short but descriptive. 

## Profile Picture

To add a profile picture add a JPEG file to the content/authors/admin folder titled avatar.jpg
